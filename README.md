# Exploring Deformed Metric Tensor through Noncommutative Heisenberg Algebra and Generalized Uncertainty Principle in the Context of Quantum Mechanics and Gravitational Fields #



When considering the combination of quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR), 
we can extend the fundamental theory of QM by incorporating concepts such as the non-commutative 
Heisenberg algebra, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), and the integration of gravitational fields. 
This extension leads us to suggest a possible deformation of the metric tensor that combines the effects of QM and GR.

The deformation arises from the non-commutative algebra and the maximal space-like four-acceleration, and 
it corresponds to curvature in an 8-dimensional spacetime tangent bundle, which is a generalization of 
Riemannian spacetime. By applying this concept, we can derive a deformed metric tensor that determines how the affine connection on a Riemannian manifold is affected.
In this paper, I explored the symmetric properties of the deformed metric tensor, 
the affine connection and found out how a parallelly transported tangent vector depends on the spacelike 
four-acceleration that is given in the units of Length(L)
where
